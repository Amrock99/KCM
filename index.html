              What is Chikankari?
              Chikan is a traditional embroidery style from Lucknow, India. and it is one of Lucknow's best known textile decoration styles. There are references to embroidery similar to chikan work in India as early as 3rd century BC by Megasthenes, who mentioned use of flowered muslins by Indians. ‘The technique of creation of a chikan work is known as Chikankari’ and is a delicate and artfully done hand embroidery on a variety of textile fabric like muslin, silk, chiffon, organza, net, etc.
    
              Chikankari work is more excusite and more ethenic than other forms of work therefore it is too rare to find good and original fabric and handwork. Most of the chikankari work sold in market is machine made and the quality of fabric is also very dull. KCM provies its customers with fine fabric and original handwork and with this website the customers will have better access to there product

            Colours-->
            Having started out as a white-on-white embroidery work on muslin cloth, chikankari has now evolved and embraced the use of colours. Many say that the change is in keeping with the modern fashion trends, and still swear by the classic all-white garment. While white does rule the roost, don’t be surprised to see colourful and silk threads too tracing the motifs, making each garment more versatile in nature.

            <p>
            Motifs-->
            Floral patterns and chikankari go hand in hand. Due to its strong Persian influence, flowers have always been a staple with stems, buti and leaves added in to complete the design. Other motifs include embellishments like Mukaish, Kamdani, Badla as well as sequin, bead and mirror work, all of which give the simple work a richer look.</p>
            <p>
            Varieties-->
            The traditional muslin cloth that the art was established in has now been swapped for lighter fabrics like cotton, silk, chiffon, organza and net. The idea is to have lightweight fabric that not just makes the embroidery process easier (the needle can pass through without much resistance) but also ensures that the work stands out on its own.
            The work is found on a wide range of garments for men and women. You can buy everything from a long kurta, to a saree, anarkali, palazzos and even a range of accessories, and some home décor items like lampshades, cushion and table covers and bed throws.</p>
